This showcases how to define an AST using dynamic classes. The code is explained in the post http://abstractsyntaxseed.com/blog/defining-asts-with-dynamic-classes-in-javascript.

It has two files:
- `src/ast.js` contains the definition of the base AST node class.
- `example.js` is an example file that shows how to define the nodes and how they are used.
